```yaml
name: Pango
location: Poland
focus: backend systems, data pipelines, automation
currently: hunting open source bounties & building tools
vibe: ship fast, test everything, keep it clean
```

I like building things that work quietly in the background. Pipelines that don't break at 3am. Automation that saves someone 20 minutes a day. Code that the next person can actually read.

Right now I'm deep in the open source world - picking up bounties, contributing to projects, and building my own tools along the way. Most of my work lives in Python and TypeScript, but I'll use whatever gets the job done.

I don't have a portfolio site or a blog. My work is in the commits.

<summary><b>what I'm good at</b></summary>
<br>

**Languages & Runtimes**

`Python` `TypeScript` `JavaScript` `Node.js` `Bash`

**Backend & Data**

`asyncio` `aiohttp` `FastAPI` `PostgreSQL` `Redis` `REST APIs` `GraphQL` `WebSockets`

**Infrastructure**

`Docker` `Linux` `Git` `CI/CD` `nginx`

**What I actually enjoy**

Writing async pipelines that handle 5 data sources at once without falling over. Making tests pass on the first try. Finding a clean solution to a messy problem.

<summary><b>what I'm working on</b></summary>
<br>

- Contributing to open source projects through bounty programs
- Building config-driven data pipelines (async, multi-source, fault-tolerant)
- Automation tools that I actually use myself
- Getting better at systems design

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>how I work</b></summary>
<br>

- I write tests before I open a PR. Always.
- I commit often and keep messages clear
- I'd rather ship something solid in 2 hours than something fancy in 2 weeks
- If the README doesn't explain how to use it, it's not done
